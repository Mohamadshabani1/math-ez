			<h1>Why do we need maths?</h1>
			<p>When it was your last time you used maths out of your school / university?
                You maight say long time ago or i never used
                but What if i asked you when it was your last time you used your
                phone / laptop for sure you are using it now....
                Do you know every technology you see is full of maths and without these
                long mathematical equations they are going to disappear!.
                Maths is every where not in technology only it is in every single purchase you 
                make! it is in every heart beat and in every single breath!
